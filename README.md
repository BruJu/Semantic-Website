# Semantic Website

This is a MVP demonstration of one of the dev prototypes I made in 2021-02 that
uses a triple store to build a website.

I made this small example mainly to test my host provider ability to host
Node.js websites.

## How to run locally

- Install dependencies `npm install`
- You probably want to modify the value of `baseIRI` in `index.js`and the port
to a number.
- `$ node index.js`
